== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= User registration clears shopping cart? =
If your cart is getting empty after a new account is created, there are some things you could try:
 - Enable the option **Advanced > Custom logout function**.
 - Set the **Advanced > Prevent login after register > Login prevention method** option as **Use login filter from WooCommerce**.

= When a user registers, it gives an error. How can I fix it? =
Set the **Advanced > Prevent login after register > Login prevention method** option as **Use login filter from WooCommerce**.

= How to eliminate spam registrations? =
If you use some options combined, you'll be able to remove the unverified users automatically, eliminating spam registrations.
This is what you can do:

- Disable **General > Enable email verification for already registered users** (This is optional, however it's more safe)
- Enable **Advanced > Delete users automatically**
- Set **General > Expire time** (This is optional but it's more safe, because you'll be removing only unverified users whose activation have expired. This is a [Pro](https://wpfactory.com/item/email-verification-for-woocommerce/) feature though)

= What can I do if I get a 403 error or have issues when trying to save settings? =
Some servers have security solutions that do not allow saving settings with HTML tags.
You can try to contact them asking to disable it, or you can try our option:

- **Advanced > Replace HTML tags**

It will try to convert the angle brackets from HTML tags by other characters.
After that, you'll just need to save the settings page once more. On the frontend the characters will be converted to HTML tags again.

= Why the activation message ("Thank you for your registration...") is not getting displayed after registration? =
Please try to make sure that at least one of the above options are enabled.
If just some of them are already enabled and even so it doesn't work, try to enable all of the them:

-  **Advanced > Prevent login after register**
-  **Advanced > Prevent login after checkout**
-  **Logout unverified users on "My Account" page**
-  **Logout unverified users on every page**

= How to prevent duplicated success message after account verification? =
Please try to use **General > Redirect on success** option as **Do not redirect**

= If a unverified user tries to login how to priorize verification error message over incorrect password ? =
Try to set the **Advanced > Authenticate filter** option as **authenticate filter**

= What can I do if the error messages are not showing? =
If an unverified user is trying to login and the error message (Your account has to be activated before you can login...) is not getting displayed you can try two different approaches:

1. Use the **Redirect on failure** option.
Even if the **Custom redirect URL** option is empty, there will be no problem.
A `?alg_wc_ev_email_verified_error` argument will be added to the URL that could help you displaying the message.

2. Change the **Advanced > Authenticate filter** option.

= How to use the alg_wc_ev_verification_status shortcode ? =
You can use the `[alg_wc_ev_verification_status]` shortcode to display the verification status, showing if current user is verified or not.
Params for the `[alg_wc_ev_verification_status]` shortcode:

- **wrapper_template**: `<div class="alg-wc-ev-verification-status">{content_template}</div>`
- **content_template**: `Verification status: {verification_status}`
- **verified_status**: `Verified`
- **unverified_status**: `Unverified`
- **hide_if_verified**: `false`
- **hide_for_guests**: `false`

**wrapper_template** params:

- **{content_template}**

**content_template** params:

- **{verification_status}**
- **{user_display_name}**
- **{user_nicename}**

= How to use the alg_wc_ev_resend_verification_url shortcode ? =
You can use the `[alg_wc_ev_resend_verification_url]` shortcode to display a message with a link to the verification url.
Params for the `[alg_wc_ev_resend_verification_url]` shortcode:

- **wrapper_template**: `<div class="alg-wc-ev-resend-verification-url">{content_template}</div>`
- **content_template**: `You can resend the email with verification link by clicking <a href="{resend_verification_url}">here</a>.`
- **hide_if_verified**: `true`
- **hide_for_guests**: `false`

**content_template** params:

- **{resend_verification_url}**

= How to use the alg_wc_ev_email_content_placeholder shortcode ? =
You can use the `[alg_wc_ev_email_content_placeholder]` shortcode to append the verification email to some custom email template.
In order to use it, it's necessary to:

- Enable the option **Email > Activation email > Fine tune activation email placement**
- Disable the option **Email > Activation email > Send as a separate email**
- Most probably the option **Emails > Activation email > Email template** should be set as **Plain**

Params for the `[alg_wc_ev_email_content_placeholder]` shortcode:

- **user_email**
