Verify user emails in WooCommerce. Beautifully.

== Description ==

**Email Verification for WooCommerce** plugin lets you add email verification to WooCommerce.

= Main Features =

* Require **email verification** for new user registrations.
* Optionally enable email verification for **already registered users**.
* Skip email verification for selected **user roles**.
* Customize **frontend messages**.
* Optionally manually **verify**, **unverify**, **resend** email activation link **by admin**.
* Optionally **delete unverified users** from the database (manually or automatically once per week).
* Select if you want to send verification as a **separate email**, or **append** it to the standard WooCommerce "Customer new account" email.
* **Delay** standard WooCommerce **"Customer new account" email** until after successful verification (in a separate email).
* **Prevent** automatic user **login after registration**, including registration during checkout.
* And more...

= Premium Version =

* **User email customization options**, including wrapping in standard WooCommerce email template.
* **Block "Thank you"** (i.e. "Order received") **page** access for non-verified users.
* **Block** standard WooCommerce customer **order emails** ("Order on-hold", "Processing order", "Completed order") for all non-verified users.
* **Block guests** from adding products to the cart.
* **Block checkout process** for non-verified users.
* Set activation link **expiration time**.
* Send **email to the admin** when new user verifies his email.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= User registration clears shopping cart? =
If your cart is getting cleared after a new account is created, try to enable the option **Custom logout function** available on the **Advanced** section.

= How to eliminate spam registrations? =
If you use some options combined, you'll be able to remove the unverified users automatically, eliminating spam registrations.
This is what you can do:

- Disable **General > Enable email verification for already registered users** (This is optional, however it's more safe)
- Enable **Advanced > Delete users automatically**
- Set **General > Expire time** (This is optional but it's more safe, because you'll be removing only unverified users whose activation have expired. This is a [Pro](https://wpfactory.com/item/email-verification-for-woocommerce/) feature though)

= What can I do if I get a 403 error or have issues when trying to save settings? =
Some servers have security solutions that do not allow saving settings with HTML tags.
You can try to contact them asking to disable it, or you can try our option:

- **Advanced > Replace HTML tags**

It will try to convert the angle brackets from HTML tags by other characters.
After that, you'll just need to save the settings page once more. On the frontend the characters will be converted to HTML tags again.

= Why the activation message ("Thank you for your registration...") is not getting displayed after registration? =
Please try to make sure that at least one of the above options are enabled.
If just some of them are already enabled and even so it doesn't work, try to enable all of the them:

-  **Advanced > Prevent login after register**
-  **Advanced > Prevent login after checkout**
-  **Logout unverified users on "My Account" page**
-  **Logout unverified users on every page**
